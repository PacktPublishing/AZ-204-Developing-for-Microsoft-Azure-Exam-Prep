# Lab 12: Enhance a web application by using the Azure Content Delivery Network

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: **Admin**

- Password: **Pa55w.rd**

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icon for the application that you'll use in this lab:

- Microsoft Edge

    > **Note**: For example, if your **Endpoint hostname** URL is `https://cdnvideostudent.azureedge.net/`, your newly constructed URL would be `https://cdnvideostudent.azureedge.net/welcome.mp4`.


1. On the taskbar, activate the shortcut menu for the **Microsoft Edge** icon, and then select **New window**.

1. In the new browser window, refer to the URL that you constructed for the **campus.jpg** media resource, and then verify that the resource was successfully found.

    > **Note**: If the content isn't available yet, the CDN endpoint is still initializing. This initialization process can take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes.

1. Refer to the URL that you constructed for the **conference.jpg** media resource, and then verify that the resource was successfully found.

1. Refer to the URL that you constructed for the **poster.jpg** media resource, and then verify that the resource was successfully found.

1. Refer to the URL that you constructed for the **welcome.mp4** video resource, and then verify that the resource was successfully found.

1. Close the browser window that you created in this task.

#### Task 3: Update the Web App settings

1. On the Azure portal's navigation pane, select **Resource groups**.

1. On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **MarketingContent** resource group that you created previously in this lab.

1. On the **MarketingContent** blade, select the **landingpage**_[yourname]_ web app that you created previously in this lab.

1. On the **App Service** blade, in the **Settings** category, select the **Configuration** link.

1. In the **Configuration** section, select the **Application settings** tab.

1. Select the existing **CDNMediaEndpoint** application setting.

1. In the **Add/Edit application setting** pop-up dialog box, update the **Value** text box by entering the **Endpoint hostname** URL from the **cdnmedia**_[yourname]_ endpoint that you copied previously in the lab, and then select **OK**.

1. Select the existing **CDNVideoEndpoint** application setting.

1. In the **Add/Edit application setting** pop-up dialog box, update the **Value** text box by entering the **Endpoint hostname** URL from the **cdnvideo**_[yourname]_ endpoint that you copied previously in the lab, and then select **OK**.

1. Select **Save**, and then select **Continue** to confirm your changes.  

    > **Note**: Wait for your application settings to persist before you move forward with the lab.

1. In the **Configuration** section, select **Overview**.

1. In the **Overview** section, select **Restart**, and then select **Yes** to confirm the app restart process.

    > **Note**: Wait for the restart operation to complete before you continue with the lab. You'll receive a notification when the operation is done.

#### Task 4: Test the web content

1. On the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Resource groups** link.

1. On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **MarketingContent** resource group that you created previously in this lab.

1. On the **MarketingContent** blade, select the **contentdeliverynetwork** CDN profile that you created previously in this lab.

1. On the **CDN profile** blade, select the **cdnweb**_[yourname]_ endpoint.

1. On the **Endpoint** blade, copy the value of the **Endpoint hostname** link.

1. On the taskbar, activate the shortcut menu for the **Microsoft Edge** icon, and then select **New window**.

1. In the new browser window, refer to the **Endpoint hostname** URL for the **cdnweb**_[yourname]_ endpoint.

1. Observe the website and multimedia content that are all served using Content Delivery Network.

#### Review

In this exercise, you updated your web app to use Content Delivery Network to serve multimedia content and to serve the web application itself.

### Exercise 5: Clean up your subscription

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell

1. In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon ![Cloud Shell icon](./media/az204_lab_CloudShell.png) to open a new Bash session. If Cloud Shell defaults to a PowerShell session, select **PowerShell**, and then in the drop-down menu, select **Bash**.

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you're starting **Cloud Shell**, when prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. When you're presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you're using in this lab, and select **Create storage**.

#### Task 2: Delete a resource group

1. On the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to delete the **MarketingContent** resource group:

    ```bash
    az group delete --name MarketingContent --no-wait --yes
    ```

    > **Note**: The command runs asynchronously (as determined by the *--no-wait* parameter), so while you'll be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it'll take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane in the portal.

#### Task 3: Close the active application

1. Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource group that was used in this lab.
