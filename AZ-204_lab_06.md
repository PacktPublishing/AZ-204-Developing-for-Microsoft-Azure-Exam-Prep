# Lab 06: Authenticate by using OpenID Connect, MSAL, and .NET SDKs

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:
    
-   Username: **Admin**

-   Password: **Pa55w.rd**

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab, including:

-   Microsoft Edge

-   Visual Studio Code

## Ensure that your lab environment has its time set properly (no delay, according to your timezone)

>**Note:** If you notice that your lab environment has its time delayed, please adjust its local time by using the following powershell command to increase the time by 15 minutes

```powershell
  Set-Date -Adjust (New-TimeSpan -Minutes 15)
```

When the **You have no storage mounted** message appears, select the subscription you're using in this lab, and then select **Create storage**.

1.  In the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to sign in to the Azure AD tenant associated with your Azure subscription:

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzureAD
    ```

1.  Run the following command to retrieve and display the primary Domain Name System (DNS) domain name of the Azure AD tenant:

    ```powershell
    $aadDomainName = ((Get-AzureAdTenantDetail).VerifiedDomains)[0].Name
    $aadDomainName
    ```

    > **Note**: Record the value of the DNS domain name. You'll use this value later in the lab.

1.  Run the following commands to create Azure AD users that you'll use to test Azure AD authentication:

    ```powershell
    $passwordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile
    $passwordProfile.Password = 'Pa55w.rd1234'
    $passwordProfile.ForceChangePasswordNextLogin = $false
    New-AzureADUser -AccountEnabled $true -DisplayName 'aad_lab_user1' -PasswordProfile $passwordProfile -MailNickName 'aad_lab_user1' -UserPrincipalName "aad_lab_user1@$aadDomainName" 
    ```

1.  Run the following command to identify the user principal name (UPN) of the newly created Azure AD user:

    ```powershell
    (Get-AzureADUser -Filter "MailNickName eq 'aad_lab_user1'").UserPrincipalName
    ```

    > **Note**: Record the UPN. You'll use this value later in the lab.

    > **Note**: Alternatively, you can retrieve the UPN by using the Azure portal, go to Azure Active Directory, select Users blade and search by giving the userid as input.
