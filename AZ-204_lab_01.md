# Lab 01: Build a web application on Azure platform as a service offering

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:

- Username: **Admin**

- Password: **Pa55w.rd**

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

> **Active Subscriptions**: If you have multiple active subscriptions. You can always specify which subscription to work in by using the subscription parameter in your command. Visit here for more information on how to manage subscription by using [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli), [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/azurerm/manage-subscriptions-azureps?view=azurermps-6.13.0)

```
# get a list of your subscriptions with the az account list command
az account list --output table

# get the current default subscription using show
az account show --output table

# to switch to a different subscription, use az account set with the subscription ID or name you want to switch to.
az account set --subscription "Subscription Name" or "Subscription ID"
```

#### Review the installed applications
Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab, including:

- Microsoft Edge
- File Explorer
- Windows Terminal
- Visual Studio Code

1. On the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to delete the **ManagedPlatform** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name ManagedPlatform --no-wait --yes
    ```

    > **Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the *--no-wait* parameter). While you'll be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately after the command executes, within the same Bash session, it'll take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane in the portal.

#### Task 3: Close the active applications

- Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource groups used in this lab.
