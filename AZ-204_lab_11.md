    ```

    > **Note**: This line of code forces the web API to use HTTPS. For this lab, this is unnecessary.

1.  At the beginning of the definition of the **Startup** class, add a new static string constant named **INSTRUMENTATION_KEY** with the value set to the Application Insights resource instrumentation key that you recorded previously in this lab:

    ```csharp
    private const string INSTRUMENTATION_KEY = "instrumentation_key";
    ```

    > **Note**: For example, if your instrumentation key is `d2bb0eed-1342-4394-9b0c-8a56d21aaa43`, that line of code would be `private const string INSTRUMENTATION_KEY = "d2bb0eed-1342-4394-9b0c-8a56d21aaa43";`

1.  Locate the **ConfigureServices** method in the **Startup** class:

    ```csharp
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
    }
    ```

1.  Starting from a new line, add the following code at the end of the **ConfigureServices** method to configure Application Insights using the provided instrumentation key:

    ```csharp
    services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(INSTRUMENTATION_KEY);
    ```

1.  Review the **ConfigureServices** method, which should now contain the following code:

    ```csharp
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
        services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(INSTRUMENTATION_KEY);        
    }

1.  Switch to the **Visual Studio Code** window.

1.  At the terminal prompt, run the following command to set the current directory to the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\11\\Starter\\Api**, where the deployment files reside:

    ```
    cd F:\Allfiles\Labs\11\Starter\Api
    ```

1.  Run the following command to import version 2.18.0 of **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights** from NuGet to the current project:

    ```
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights --version 2.18.0
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet add package** command will add the **Microsoft.ApplicationInsights** package from NuGet. For more information, refer to [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights).

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, in the **Explorer** pane, navigate to the **Controllers** directory, and then open the file **WeatherForecastController.cs**.

1.  Review the content of the file and note that it includes the `using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` directive and a constructor injection for the generic ILogger<WeatherForecastController> interface.

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
    namespace SimpleApi.Controllers
    {
        [ApiController]
        [Route("[controller]")]
        public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
        {
            private static readonly string[] Summaries = new[]
            {
                "Freezing", "Bracing", "Chilly", "Cool", "Mild", "Warm", "Balmy", "Hot", "Sweltering", "Scorching"
            };
            private readonly ILogger<WeatherForecastController> _logger;
            public WeatherForecastController(ILogger<WeatherForecastController> logger)
            {
                _logger = logger;
            }
            [HttpGet]
            public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()
            {
                var rng = new Random();
                return Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index => new WeatherForecast
                {
                    Date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(index),
                    TemperatureC = rng.Next(-20, 55),
                    Summary = Summaries[rng.Next(Summaries.Length)]
                })
                .ToArray();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    > **Note**: You'll leverage this configuration to implement custom logging. Currently, the constructor displays a group of five randomly generated weather forecasts. You'll modify the controller to display one forecast at a time. For each forecast, you'll generate an informational, warning, or error log entry indicating the type of weather (mild, severe, and extreme). After these log entries are recorded by Application Insights in the corresponding Log Analytics workspace, each entry will have an automatically assigned severity level of 1, 2, or 3. 

1.  Locate the `var rng = new Random();` line in the `public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()` method in the file **WeatherForecastController.cs**, and then add the following code starting with the next line:

    ```csharp
            int temperatureC = rng.Next(-20, 55);
            var summaryId = rng.Next(Summaries.Length);
            switch (summaryId)
            {
                case 0: case 9:
                _logger.LogError("WeatherForecast: extreme weather");
                break;
                case 1: case 2: case 7: case 8:
                _logger.LogWarning("WeatherForecast: severe weather");
                break;
                default:
                _logger.LogInformation("WeatherForecast: mild weather");
                break;
            }
    ```

1.  Modify the `return` statement so it has the following content:

    ```csharp
            return Enumerable.Range(1, 1).Select(index => new WeatherForecast
            {
                Date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(index),
                TemperatureC = temperatureC,
                Summary = Summaries[summaryId]
            })
            .ToArray();
    ```

1.   Save and close the file.

1.  At the terminal prompt, run the following command to build the .NET Web API:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

#### Task 2: Test logging of a .NET Core API app

1.  Run the following command to launch the .NET Web API.

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > **Note**: Keep the web API running and monitor the output of the Visual Studio Code **terminal** pane as you perform the next steps in this task.

1.  On your lab computer, from the taskbar, open the context menu for the **Microsoft Edge** icon, and then open a new browser window.

    > **Note**: Position the browser window such that it doesn't block the Visual Studio Code **terminal** pane.

1.  In the open browser window, navigate to `http://localhost:5000/weatherforecast`, and then refresh the page several times.

    > **Note**: Each time you refresh the page, it should display a different weather forecast in the following format.

    ```
    [{"date":"2021-09-04T14:35:29.0789168-07:00","temperatureC":2,"temperatureF":35,"summary":"Sweltering"}]
    ```

    > **Note**: Each refresh of the page should result in an informational, warning, or error message display at the terminal prompt, in the following format:

    ```
    warn: SimpleApi.Controllers.WeatherForecastController[0]
      WeatherForecast: severe weather
    ```

    > **Note**: Refresh the page several times to ensure that you generated at least one message of each type (**info**, **warn**, and **fail**).

1.  Leave the API app running.

#### Task 3: Review the Application Insights logging

1.  On your lab computer, switch to the **Microsoft Edge** browser window displaying the Azure portal.

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate back to the blade of the **instrm**_[yourname]_ Application Insights resource you created previously in this lab.

1.  On the **Application Insights** blade, in the **Monitoring** section, select **Logs**.

1.  If needed, close the **Welcome to Log Analytics** pane and **Queries** pane.

1.  In the **New Query** pane, type the following query and select **Run**:

    ```
    traces
    | order by timestamp desc
    ```

1.  Review the results of the query.

    > **Note**: The results should include log entries corresponding to the warning and error messages generated by the .NET Core api app, with their respective severity levels (2 and 3).

    > **Note**: It can take up to five minutes to observe requests in the Application Insights metrics charts.

    The following screenshot displays the log query results on the **Application Insights Logs** blade.

    ![Log query results on the Application Insights Logs blade](./media/l11_web_api_insights_logs.png)

    > **Note**: You could deploy the updated API app to an Azure web app to collect its logs using Application Insights in an equivalent manner.

    > **Note**: You can extend the Application Insights logging level to include informational events by modifying the **appsettings.Development.json** (or **appsettings.json**) file as illustrated in the following code listing. However, you should keep in mind that this will considerably increase the log volume, which has potential network performance and pricing implications:

    ```
    {
      "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Information",
          "Microsoft": "Warning",
          "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
        },
        "ApplicationInsights": {
          "LogLevel": {
            "Microsoft": "Information"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1.  Close the browser window displaying the output of your API app.

1.  Switch to the **Visual Studio Code** window, and then select **Kill Terminal** (the **Recycle Bin** icon) to close the **terminal** pane and any associated processes.

#### Review

In this exercise, you configured and tested Application Insights logging of your web API app.

### Exercise 5: Clean up your subscription

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell

1.  In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon ![Cloud Shell icon](./media/az204_lab_CloudShell.png) to open a new PowerShell session. If Cloud Shell defaults to a PowerShell session, select **PowerShell**, and in the drop-down menu, select **Bash**.

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you're starting **Cloud Shell**, when prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **Bash**. When you're presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you're using in this lab, and select **Create storage**.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  On the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to delete the **MonitoredAssets** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name MonitoredAssets --no-wait --yes
    ```

    > **Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the *--no-wait* parameter), so while you'll be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it'll take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane in the portal.

#### Task 3: Close the active applications

1.  Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

1.  Close the currently running Visual Studio Code application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource groups used in this lab.
