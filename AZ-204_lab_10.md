# Lab 10: Asynchronously process messages by using Azure Service Bus Queues

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:
    
-   Username: **Admin**

-   Password: **Pa55w.rd**

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab, including:
    
-   Microsoft Edge

-   Visual Studio Code

## Architecture diagram

### Exercise 1: Create Azure resources

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1.  On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1.  In the browser window, browse to the Azure portal ([portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)) and sign in with the account you'll be using for this lab.

    > **Note**: If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, you'll be offered a tour of the portal. Select **Get Started** to skip the tour and begin using the portal.

#### Task 2: Create an Azure Service Bus queue

1.  In the Azure portal, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box to search for **Service Bus** and then, in the list of results, select **Service Bus**.

1.  On the **Service Bus** blade, select **+ Create**.

1.  On the **Create namespace** blade, on the **Basics** tab, perform the following actions, and select **Review + create**:
        
    | Setting                           | Action                                                       |
    | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | **Subscription** drop-down list    |Retain the default value. |
    | **Resource group** section | Select **Create new**, enter **AsyncProcessor**, and then select **OK**.|
    | **Namespace name** text box | Enter **sbnamespace**_[yourname]_.|
    | **Region** drop-down list |  Select any Azure region in which you can deploy an Azure Service Bus.|
    | **Pricing tier** drop-down list |  Select **Basic**.|

    The following screenshot displays the configured settings on the **Basics** tab on the **Create namespace** blade.
    
       ![Create an Azure Service Bus namespace blade](./media/l10_create_sb_namespace.png)
     
1.  On the **Review + create** tab, review the options that you selected during the previous steps.

1.  Select **Create** to create the **Service Bus** namespace by using your specified configuration.

    > **Note**: Wait for the creation task to complete before you proceed with this lab.

1.  On the **Deployment** blade, select the **Go to resource** button to navigate to the blade of the newly created **Service Bus** namespace.

1.  On the **Service Bus** namespace blade, in the **Settings** section, select **Shared access policies**.

1.  In the list of policies, select **RootManageSharedAccessKey**.

1.  On the **SAS Policy: RootManageSharedAccessKey** pane, next to the **Primary Connection String** entry, select the **Copy to clipboard** button, and record the copied value. You'll use it later in this lab.

    > **Note**: It doesn't matter which of the two available keys you choose. They are interchangeable.

1.  On the **Service Bus** namespace blade, in the **Entities** section, select **Queues**, and then select **+ Queue**.

1.  On the **Create queue** blade, review the available settings, in the **Name** text box, enter **messagequeue**, and then select **Create**.

1.  Select **messagequeue** to display the properties of the **Service Bus** queue.

1.  Leave the browser window open. You'll use it again later in this lab.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created an Azure **Service Bus** namespace and a **Service Bus** queue that you'll use through the remainder of the lab.

### Exercise 2: Create a .NET Core project to publish messages to a Service Bus queue

#### Task 1: Create a .NET Core project

1.  From the lab computer, start Visual Studio Code.

1.  In Visual Studio Code, in the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.

1.  In the **Open Folder** window, browse to **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\10\\Starter\\MessagePublisher**, and then select **Select Folder**.

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, activate the shortcut menu, and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

1.  At the terminal prompt, run the following command to create a new .NET project named **MessagePublisher** in the current folder:

    ```
    dotnet new console --name MessagePublisher --output .
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet new** command will create a new **console** project in a folder with the same name as the project.

1.  Run the following command to import version 7.2.1 of the **Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus** package from NuGet:

    ```
    dotnet add package Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus --version 7.2.1
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet add package** command will add the **Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus** package from NuGet. For more information, go to [Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus/).

1.  At the terminal prompt, run the following command to build the .NET Core console application:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

1.  Select **Kill Terminal** (the **Recycle Bin** icon) to close the terminal pane and any associated processes.

#### Task 2: Publish messages to an Azure Service Bus queue

1.  In the **Explorer** pane of the **Visual Studio Code** window, open the **Program.cs** file.

1.  On the code editor tab for the **Program.cs** file, delete all the code in the existing file.

1.  Add the following lines of code to facilitate the use of the built-in namespaces that will be referenced in this file:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    ```

1.  Add the following code to import the **Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus** namespace included in the **Azure.Storage.Queues** package imported from NuGet:

    ```csharp
    using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
    ```
    
1.  Enter the following code to create a new **Program** class in the MessagePublisher namespace:

    ```csharp
    namespace MessagePublisher
    {
       public class Program
       {
       }
    }
    ```

1.  In the **Program** class, enter the following code to create a string constant named **storageConnectionString**:

    ```csharp
    private const string storageConnectionString = "";
    ```

1.  Update the **storageConnectionString** string constant by setting its value to **Primary Connection String** of the Service Bus namespace you recorded earlier in this lab.

1.  Enter the following code to create a string constant named **queueName** with a value of **messagequeue**, matching the name of the Service Bus queue you created earlier in this exercise.

    ```csharp
    private const string queueName = "messagequeue";
    ```

1.  Enter the following code to create an integer constant which stores the number of messages to be sent to the target queue:

    ```csharp
    private const int numOfMessages = 3;
    ```

1.  Enter the following code to create a Service Bus client that will own the connection to the target queue:

    ```csharp
    static ServiceBusClient client;
    ```

1.  Enter the following code to create a Service Bus sender that will be used to publish messages to the target queue:

    ```csharp
    static ServiceBusSender sender;
    ```

1.  Enter the following code to create an asynchronous **Main** method:

    ```csharp
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
    }
    ```

1.  Review the **Program.cs** file, which should now include the following code. Note that the `<storage-connection-string>` placeholder represents the connection string to the target Azure Service Bus namespace:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
    namespace MessagePublisher
    {
        public class Program
        {
            private const string storageConnectionString = "<storage-connection-string>";
            private const string queueName = "messagequeue";
            private const int numOfMessages = 3;
            static ServiceBusClient client;
            static ServiceBusSender sender;
            public static async Task Main(string[] args)
            {
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, add the following code to initialize *client* of type **ServiceBusClient** that will provide connectivity to the Service Bus namespace and **sender** that will be responsible for sending messages:

    ```csharp
    client = new ServiceBusClient(storageConnectionString);
    sender = client.CreateSender(queueName);  
    ```

    > **Note**: The Service Bus client is safe to cache and use as a singleton for the lifetime of the application. This is considered one of the best practices when publishing and reading messages on a regular basis.

1.  In the **Main** method, add the following code to create a **ServiceBusMessageBatch** object that will allow you to combine multiple messages into a batch by using the **TryAddMessage** method:

    ```csharp
    using ServiceBusMessageBatch messageBatch = await sender.CreateMessageBatchAsync();
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to add messages to a batch and throw an exception if a message size exceeds the limits supported by the batch:

    ```csharp
    for (int i = 1; i <= numOfMessages; i++)
    {
        if (!messageBatch.TryAddMessage(new ServiceBusMessage($"Message {i}")))
        {
            throw new Exception($"The message {i} is too large to fit in the batch.");
        }
    }
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to create a try block, with **sender** asynchronously publishing messages in the batch to the target queue:

    ```csharp
    try
    {
        await sender.SendMessagesAsync(messageBatch);
        Console.WriteLine($"A batch of {numOfMessages} messages has been published to the queue.");
    }
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to create a finally block that asynchronously disposes of the **sender** and **client** objects, releasing any network and unmanaged resources:

    ```csharp
    finally
    {
        await sender.DisposeAsync();
        await client.DisposeAsync();
    }
    ```

1.  Review the **Main** method, which should now consist of the following code: 

    ```csharp
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        client = new ServiceBusClient(storageConnectionString);
        sender = client.CreateSender(queueName);
        using ServiceBusMessageBatch messageBatch = await sender.CreateMessageBatchAsync();
        for (int i = 1; i <= numOfMessages; i++)
        {
            if (!messageBatch.TryAddMessage(new ServiceBusMessage($"Message {i}")))
            {
                throw new Exception($"The message {i} is too large to fit in the batch.");
            }
        }
        try
        {
            await sender.SendMessagesAsync(messageBatch);
            Console.WriteLine($"A batch of {numOfMessages} messages has been published to the queue.");
        }
        finally
        {
            await sender.DisposeAsync();
            await client.DisposeAsync();
        }
    }
    ```

1.  Save the **Program.cs** file.

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, activate the shortcut menu, and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

1.  At the terminal prompt, run the following command to launch the .NET Core console app:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > **Note**: If you encounter any errors, review the **Program.cs** file in the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\10\\Solution\\MessagePublisher** folder.

1.  Verify that the console message displayed at the terminal prompt states that a batch of three messages has been published to queue.

1.  Select **Kill Terminal** (the **Recycle Bin** icon) to close the terminal pane and any associated processes.

1.  Switch to the Microsoft Edge browser displaying the Service Bus queue **messagequeue** in the Azure portal.

1.  Review the **Essentials** pane and note that the queue contains three active messages.

    The following screenshot displays the Service Bus queue metrics and message count.
     
       ![Service Bus queue metrics and message count in the Azure portal](./media/l10_display_queue_with_messages_portal.png)
     
1.  Select **Service Bus Explorer (preview)** blade.

1.  Select the **Peek Mode** tab header and, on the **Queue** tab, select the **Peek from start** button.

1.  Verify that the queue contains three messages.

1.  Select the first message and review its content in the **Message** pane.

    The following screenshot displays the first message's content.
         
       ![Service Bus queue content in Service Bus Explorer](./media/l10_peek_queue_with_messages_explorer.png)

     
1.  Close the **Message** pane.

#### Review

In this exercise, you configured your .NET project that published messages into an Azure Service Bus queue.

### Exercise 3: Create a .NET Core project to read messages from a Service Bus queue

#### Task 1: Create a .NET project

1.  From the lab computer, start Visual Studio Code.

1.  In Visual Studio Code, in the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.

1.  In the **Open Folder** window, browse to **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\10\\Starter\\MessageReader**, and then select **Select Folder**.

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, activate the shortcut menu, and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

1.  At the terminal prompt, run the following command to create a new .NET project named **MessageReader** in the current folder:

    ```
    dotnet new console --name MessageReader --output .
    ```

1.  Run the following command to import version 7.2.1 of the **Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus** package from NuGet:

    ```
    dotnet add package Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus --version 7.2.1
    ```

1.  At the terminal prompt, run the following command to build the .NET Core console application:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

1.  Select **Kill Terminal** (the **Recycle Bin** icon) to close the terminal pane and any associated processes.

#### Task 2: Read messages from an Azure Service Bus queue

1.  In the **Explorer** pane of the **Visual Studio Code** window, open the **Program.cs** file.

1.  On the code editor tab for the **Program.cs** file, delete all the code in the existing file.

1.  Add the same code which was included in the Program.cs file to allow for interaction with Azure Service Bus queues, but set the namespace to **MessageReader**:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
    namespace MessageReader
    {
       public class Program
       {
          private const string storageConnectionString = "";
          static string queueName = "messagequeue";
          static ServiceBusClient client;
       }
    }
    ```

1.  As before, update the **storageConnectionString** string constant by setting its value to **Primary Connection String** of the **Service Bus** namespace you recorded earlier in this lab.

1.  Enter the following code to create a ServiceBusProcessor that will be used to process messages from the queue:

    ```csharp
    static ServiceBusProcessor processor;
    ```

1.  Enter the following code to create a static async **MessageHandler** task that displays the body of messages in the queue as they are being processed and deletes them after the processing completes:

    ```csharp
    static async Task MessageHandler(ProcessMessageEventArgs args)
    {
        string body = args.Message.Body.ToString();
        Console.WriteLine($"Received: {body}");
        await args.CompleteMessageAsync(args.Message);
    }
    ```

1.  Enter the following code to create a static async **ErrorHandler** task that manages any exceptions encountered during message processing:

    ```csharp
    static Task ErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(args.Exception.ToString());
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
    ```

1.  Enter the following code to create an asynchronous **Main** method:

    ```csharp
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
    }
    ```

1.  Review the **Program.cs** file, which should now include the following code. The `<storage-connection-string>` placeholder represents the connection string to the target Azure Service Bus namespace:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
    namespace MessageReader
    {
        class Program
        {
            static string storageConnectionString = "";
            static string queueName = "messagequeue";
            static ServiceBusClient client;
            static ServiceBusProcessor processor;
            static async Task MessageHandler(ProcessMessageEventArgs args)
            {
                string body = args.Message.Body.ToString();
                Console.WriteLine($"Received: {body}");
                await args.CompleteMessageAsync(args.Message);
            }
            static Task ErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs args)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(args.Exception.ToString());
                return Task.CompletedTask;
            }
            static async Task Main()
            {
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, add the following code to initialize *client* of type **ServiceBusClient** that will provide connectivity to the Service Bus namespace and **processor** that will be responsible for processing of messages:

    ```csharp
    client = new ServiceBusClient(storageConnectionString);
    processor = client.CreateProcessor(queueName, new ServiceBusProcessorOptions());
    ```

    > **Note**: As mentioned earlier, the Service Bus client is safe to cache and use as a singleton for the lifetime of the application. This is considered one of the best practices when publishing and reading messages on a regular basis.

1.  In the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to create a try block, which first implements a message and error processing handler, initiates message processing, and stops processing following a user input:

    ```csharp
    try
    {
        processor.ProcessMessageAsync += MessageHandler;
        processor.ProcessErrorAsync += ErrorHandler;
        await processor.StartProcessingAsync();
        Console.WriteLine("Wait for a minute and then press any key to end the processing");
        Console.ReadKey();
        Console.WriteLine("\nStopping the receiver...");
        await processor.StopProcessingAsync();
        Console.WriteLine("Stopped receiving messages");
    }
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to create a finally block that asynchronously disposes of the **processor** and **client** objects, releasing any network and unmanaged resources:

    ```csharp
    finally
    {
        await processor.DisposeAsync();
        await client.DisposeAsync();
    }
    ```

1.  Review the **Main** method, which should now consist of the following code:

    ```csharp
    static async Task Main()
    {
        client = new ServiceBusClient(storageConnectionString);
        processor = client.CreateProcessor(queueName, new ServiceBusProcessorOptions());
        try
        {
            processor.ProcessMessageAsync += MessageHandler;
            processor.ProcessErrorAsync += ErrorHandler;
            await processor.StartProcessingAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Wait for a minute and then press any key to end the processing");
            Console.ReadKey();
            Console.WriteLine("\nStopping the receiver...");
            await processor.StopProcessingAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Stopped receiving messages");
        }
        finally
        {
            await processor.DisposeAsync();
            await client.DisposeAsync();
        }
    }
    ```

1.  Save the **Program.cs** file.

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, activate the shortcut menu, and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

1.  At the terminal prompt, run the following command to launch the .NET Core console app:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > **Note**: If you encounter any errors, review the **Program.cs** file in the **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\10\\Solution\\MessageReader** folder.

1.  Verify that the console message displayed at the terminal prompt states that each of the three messages in the queue has been received.

1.  At the terminal prompt, press any key to stop the receiver and terminate the app execution.

1.  Select **Kill Terminal** (the **Recycle Bin** icon) to close the terminal pane and any associated processes.

1.  Switch back to the Microsoft Edge browser displaying the Service Bus queue **messagequeue** in the Azure portal.

1.  On the **Service Bus Explorer (preview)** blade, select **Refresh**, and note that the number of active messages in the queue has changed to **0**.

#### Review

In this exercise, you read and deleted messages from the Azure Service Bus queue by using the .NET library.

### Exercise 4: Clean up your subscription

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell

1.  In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon ![Cloud Shell icon](./media/az204_lab_CloudShell.png) to open a new Bash session. If Cloud Shell defaults to a PowerShell session, select **PowerShell** and, in the drop-down menu, select **Bash**.

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell**, when prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. When you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and select **Create storage**.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  In the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to delete the **AsyncProcessor** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name AsyncProcessor --no-wait --yes
    ```
    
     > **Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the *--no-wait* parameter), so while you'll be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it'll take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
  
1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane in the portal.

#### Task 3: Close the active applications

1.  Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

1.  Close the currently running Visual Studio Code application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource groups used in this lab.
