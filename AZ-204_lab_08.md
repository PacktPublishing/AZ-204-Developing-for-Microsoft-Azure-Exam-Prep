# Lab 08: Create a multi-tier solution by using Azure services

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community alerts us to needed changes. However, cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**


## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab environment

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:
    
-   Username: **Admin**

-   Password: **Pa55w.rd**

> **Note**: Your instructor will provide instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab:
    
-   Microsoft Edge

### Exercise 3: Clean up your subscription

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell

1.  In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon ![Cloud Shell icon](./media/az204_lab_CloudShell.png) to open a new Bash session. If Cloud Shell defaults to a PowerShell session, select **PowerShell** and then, in the drop-down menu, select **Bash**.

      > **Note**: If this is the first time you're starting **Cloud Shell**, when prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. When you're presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you're using in this lab, and then select **Create storage**.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  On the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to delete the **ApiService** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name ApiService --no-wait --yes
    ```
    
     > **Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the *--no-wait* parameter), so while you'll be able to run another Azure CLI command immediately afterwards within the same Bash session, it'll take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
  
1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane in the portal.

#### Task 3: Close the active applications

1.  Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource groups used in this lab.
